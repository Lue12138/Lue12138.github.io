                <p>My name is Xiaohan Lu or known as Lue for short. Guess which one in the photo is me XD. </p>
                <p>I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Toronto Computer Science Specialist program and Statistics Major. 
                    During my years at UofT, a strong interest in "teaching” computers to solve real-world problems driven 
                    by data has been developed through courses and I have previously worked as an application engineer at 
                    UofT CHASS Data Centre.</p>
                <p>Other than academia, I gained experience by actively building projects using various techniques and frameworks. I can't list all things that I'm 
                    familiar with here, but here are several: Python, MERN stack, Java, R, SQL and I'm always learning.    
                <p>Most of my non-working 
                    time I like watching movies and I was a volunteer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival"  target=”_blank” style="color: inherit;">TIFF</a> 2022. My favorite movie is 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Down"  target=”_blank” style="color: inherit;">Falling Down</a>.</p>
